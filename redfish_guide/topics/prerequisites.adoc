== Prerequisites

The following preprequisites must be met to start using {redfish-provider-full}:

* One or more physical systems with an embedded BMC that supports {redfish}.
* Administrator credentials for the BMC.
* {product-appliance} must be able to reach {redfish-server} on the physical
  system's BMC network interface through at least one of the appliance's own
  network interface.
* For {redfish} events to work, the BMC must support the Server-Side Events
  (SSE) technology.
* One or more functional PXE servers must be configured and running on a network
  that is accessible both to {product-appliance}. The PXE servers need to be
  populated with the appropriate Operating System boot and installation files.

  their system's NICs (not the BMC network). This NIC must be able to reach the
  PXE server.
