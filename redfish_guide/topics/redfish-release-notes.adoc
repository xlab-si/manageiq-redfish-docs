== {redfish-provider-title} Release Notes

The {product-title} supports the following {redfish-provider} functionality:

* Inventory
* LED Identification Operations
* Power Operations
* Events
* Physical Server Provisioning
* Physical Server Firmware Updates

=== Inventory
{redfish-provider} collects the inventory on all of the discoverable systems,
populating the database behind the scenes. When a new provider is added,
the inventory operation is automatic. The subsequent inventory updates occur
either regularly or manually. The inventory is currently not updated upon
{redfish} events.

Depending on the capabilities of the systems under inventory, the {redfish}
may distinguish between entities such as blocks, racks, sleds, chassis, physical
servers and others. These categories are mapped into {product-title} categories
as follows:

|===============================================================================
| {product-title_short} Convention. | {redfish} Convention.
| Physical Rack                     | Rack
| Physical Chassis                  | Block, Sled, Chassis
| Physical Server                   | System
|===============================================================================


=== LED Identification Operations
Physical systems may feature a built-in LED somewhere on its enclosure that can
help visually identify the system instance by using its remotely controlled
state. {product-title} provides the following identification LED operations:

[options="header",alt="Identity LED action to status mapping"]
|===============================================================================
| Identity action.                   | Expected LED state after action.
| Turn LED On                        | On
| Turn LED Off                       | Off
| Blink LED                          | Blinking
|===============================================================================

=== Power Operations
Power operations change the status of the power supply of the system and can
also trigger a reboot of the target physical system. It is always possible
to request any power operation regardless of the system's current power
state. However, depending on the vendor's implementation, some operations
may not have any effect if the system is in a wrong state at the time when
it receives the request.

[options="header",alt="Power operation to power state mapping"]
|===============================================================================
| Power operation.                   | Expected power state after action.
| Power On                           | Powering On, On
| Power Off                          | Powering Off, Off
| Power Off Immediately              | Powering Off, Off
| Restart                            | Powering Off, Off, Powering On, On
| Restart Immediately                | Powering Off, Off, Powering On, On
|===============================================================================

The following power actions are *not* supported:

* Restart to System Setup
* Restart Management Controller

=== Events
{product-title} supports {redfish} events from the vendors that support the
Server-Side Events (SSE) technology. The events received are then completely
dependent on the vendor's implementation and the Baseboard Management Controller
(BMC) configuration.

=== Physical Server Provisioning
With {redfish-provider} it is possible to request performing bare-metal
provisioning of an operating system on the physical systems. This lets the users
boot selected physical servers into live Operating Systems or run full
Operating System installations.

{redfish-provider} relies on {product-title}'s built-in support for PXE servers
to serve the Operating System boot files and customization templates.

=== Physical Server Firmware Updates
{product-title} enables performing firmware updates of the supported {redfish}
physical systems. The Firmware Updates functionality consists of the following:

* Firmware Registry contains the list of the images, binaries and executables
  that are the payload in the firmware update process. The registry provides
  the inventory of the available firmware updates by vendor, system and model.
* Update Firmware of Physical Systems Lifecycle request, enabling requests for
  performing the firmware updates on the selected servers.
