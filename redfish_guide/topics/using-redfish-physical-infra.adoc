== Using {redfish-provider-full-title}

=== Examining {redfish-provider-title} Inventory

The physical infrastructure provider's dashboard provides an overview of the
inventory at a glance. To view it, first navigate to *Compute ->
Physical Infrastructure -> Providers* page from the main navigation on the
left, then click your {redfish-provider}.

image::docs_redfish_using01_dashboard.png[alt="{redfish-provider} dashboard",500,align="center"]

NOTE: The {redfish-provider} does not support targeted refreshing of the
inventory. To make sure that the latest information is visible, please perform
*Configuration -> Refresh Relationships and Power States*. The statuses should
be up-to-date after a few seconds.

To obtain a tabular view of the inventory, switch to the *Summary View* of the
{redfish-provider}'s dashboard:

image::docs_redfish_using02_dashboard_summary.png[alt="Summary view of {redfish-provider} dashboard",500,align="center"]

To view a list of the resources discovered through the inventory, click on
the respective row of the *Relationships* table. For example, clicking on
the *Physical Servers* row will take you to the list of physical servers:

image::docs_redfish_using12_server_list.png[alt="Summary view of all {redfish-provider} physical servers",450,align="center"]

A graphical representation of the managed data center can be displayed by
navigating to *Compute -> Physical Infrastructure -> Topology*:

image::docs_redfish_using11_topology.png[alt="Topology of {redfish-provider} entities in the inventory",450,align="center"]

=== Identifying physical systems

Many physical servers are equipped with a LED for identifying it as a specific
unit. Please use the server's documentation to locate it on the server's
chassis.

To identify a single system or a specific set of physical systems, we start by
making sure that all the LEDs are off. To do this, we visit *Compute -> Physical
Infrastructure -> Servers* from the navigation on the left. Here, we can see
from the *LED State* column the current states of the identifying LED for the
servers. To select all servers, we click on the *Select All* checkbox at the
bottom of the page. Now the *Identify* menu becomes active:

image::docs_redfish_using04_all_servers.png[alt="Identify menu and current state of the identify LED for the servers in the inventory",500,align="center"]

From the *Identify* menu, we click the *Turn Off LED*. We confirm the action
by clicking *OK* in the confirmation prompt that appears in the browser. Then
we should see the status showing the success of sending the request:

image::docs_redfish_using05_turn_off_led.png[alt="Confirmation of successfully requesting to turn off the LED",300,align="center"]

The LEDs on the servers should be off within a few seconds. To see the updated
status in the {product-gui}, use the *Configuration -> Refresh Relationships
and Power States*, wait a few seconds, then refresh the page in the browser.

image::docs_redfish_using06_refresh.png[alt="Refreshing the inventory status",200,align="center"]

To control the LED for an individual server, we can first click on the physical
server's name in the table. We obtain the physical server's summary view, which
provides the same *Identify* menu as before. Here, we can also see the state
of the identification LED:

image::docs_redfish_using03_identify.png[alt="Identify menu and current state of the identify LED",400,align="center"]

To make the server's identification LED blink, we click *Identify -> Blink
LED*. We get a prompt for confirming the action. After clicking *OK*, the
{product-gui} shows confirmation of the request sent. Shortly afterwards, the
selected server's LED should start blinking.

To see the status updated in the {product-gui}, we use the *Configuration ->
Refresh Relationships and Power States* function, then after a few seconds we
refresh the page in the browser.

Please refer to the <<ReleaseNotesRedfish>> section for further information
about the identify LED management actions and statuses.

=== Managing the Physical System's Power Status

Physical servers may be remotely powered off, powered on or restarted through
{product-gui} using {redfish-provider}.

To power off a particular physical server, we first navigate to *Compute ->
Physical Infrastructure -> Servers* from the navigation on the left. On the
server list, we click on the server's name. This takes us to the server's
summary page, which provides the *Power* menu and displays the server's
current power state:

image::docs_redfish_using08_server_power_on.png[alt="Power menu and current state of the power to the server",500,align="center"]

We can see that the server is currently powered on. To have it powered off, we
click on *Power -> Power Off Immediately*. We get a prompt to confirm the
selected action. After we click *Ok*, we will see the status showing the success
of sending the request:

image::docs_redfish_using09_turn_off_power.png[alt="Confirmation of successfully requesting to turn off the server immediately",300,align="center"]

The server should be powered off within a few seconds. To see the updated
status in the {product-gui}, use the *Configuration -> Refresh Relationships
and Power States*, wait a few seconds, then refresh the page in the browser.
Subject to server's vendor's {redfish} implementation, the power status should
cycle from *On* over *PoweringOff* to finally *Off*.

To turn on all the physical servers in a single batch operation, we visit
*Compute -> Physical Infrastructure -> Servers* from the navigation on
the left. Here, we can see from the *Power State* column the current states of
the power supply for the servers. To select all servers, we click on the *Select
All* checkbox at the bottom of the page. Now the *Power* menu becomes
active:

image::docs_redfish_using10_all_servers.png[alt="Power menu and current power state of the servers in the inventory"]

From the *Power* menu, we click the *Power On*. We confirm the action
by clicking *OK* in the confirmation prompt that appears in the browser. Then
we should see the status showing the success of sending the request.

The servers should be powered on within a few seconds. To see the updated
status in the {product-gui}, use the *Configuration -> Refresh Relationships
and Power States*, wait a few seconds, then refresh the page in the browser.
Again depending on the {redfish} implementation, the statuses will cycle from
*Off* to *PoweringOn* and finally to *On*.

Please refer to the <<ReleaseNotesRedfish>> section for further information
about the power management actions and statuses.

=== Physical Server Provisioning

{redfish-provider-full} lets the users boot physical servers into a selected
Operating System over the network. The process relies on a properly configured
DHCP and PXE servers in the data center.

Users must first create a new provisioning request and get it approved. Once
the provisioning request is approved, the {redfish-provider} places the
suitable NBP boot menus and configuration templates on the PXE server,
configures physical servers to boot over the network, and restarts them. This
in turn starts the Operating System installation or live boot.

==== Adding PXE server to the {product-title}

In {product-title}, a PXE server represents a NFS or SMB depot where certain
files and folders have a special meaning. The process of adding a PXE Server
is similar to that explained in the *PXE Provisioning* section of the
*Provisioning Virtual Machines and Instances* chapter.

We visit *Compute -> Infrastructure -> PXE*. Then, we click *Configuration ->
Add a New PXE server*. We fill in the fields to describe the server.

image::docs_redfish_using22_new_pxe_server_dialog.png[alt="New PXE Server dialog",512,align="center"]

* *Name*: enter the human-friendly display name for this PXE server.
* *Depot Type*: select the protocol supported by the server that the
  {product-appliance} can write changes to.
* *URI* (Network File System depots only): the access point to the Network
  File System mount.
* *Access URL*: the address of the HTTP server that serves the content of the
  _Customization Directory_ folder.
* *PXE Directory*: the path to the boot menu directory.
* *Customization Directory*: the path to the directory with customization
  templates.
* *Filename*: the path to the boot menu file that contains menu entries for
  all available Operating System images.

All of the paths are relative to the depot access point. During provisioning,
{product-title} will mount the depot, place the MAC-address-specific boot
menus into the _PXE Directory_, and write MAC-address-specific customization
templates to the _Customization Directory_.

We click *Add* to add the new server. Then we perform *Configuration -> Refresh
Relationships*. This will retrieve the list of available Operating System
images from the boot menu file that we listed in the *Filename* field. Give
refresh process a few seconds to finish and refresh the browser.

image::docs_redfish_using24_refresh_relationships.png[alt="PXE Server view",423,align="center"]

Once the *PXE Images* list gets populated, we first need to assign a system
image type to each PXE image. This creates an association between a PXE image
and the corresponding Customization Templates. Later, when we will create
provisioning requests, we will need to supply both the PXE image to provision
and the customization template, otherwise we won't be able to complete the
request.

image::docs_redfish_using23_pxe_server.png[alt="PXE Server view",777,align="center"]

We switch to the *System Image Types* and use *Configuration -> Add a new
System Image Type* to add new system image types as needed.

image::docs_redfish_using25_add_system_image_type.png[alt="Add new System Image Type",491,align="center"]

In the *Type* field, we leave the value *<Any>*. We confirm the new system image
type's settings by clicking *Add*.

Then we switch back to the *PXE Servers* tab and select the first PXE image,
then click *Configuration -> Edit this PXE Image*.

image::docs_redfish_using26_pxe_image.png[alt="View PXE Image properties",643,align="center"]

From the *Type* drop-down, we select the appropriate name and click *Save*. We
repeat the process for all the other PXE images.

Finally, we switch to the *Customization Templates* tab. This shows the list
of the system image types. For each system image type, we can create one or
more customization templates, which the Operating System's installer process
will use during the installation phase of the provisioning. For the Red Hat
based systems, this will be a Kickstart file.

image::docs_redfish_using27_customization_template.png[alt="Customization Template",857,align="center"]

The *Configuration* menu options let us copy an existing customization template
into a new one, add a new blank one, or edit an existing one. In all cases,
we use the *Name* field to type in a human-friendly name, provide an optional
*Description*, select from the *Image Type*, and provide the *Type*.
The *Script* is a free-form text editing field where we can type and edit
the actual script.

We should now be set to create a provisioning request.

==== Requesting Physical Server Provisioning

We start off by visiting the physical servers list in *Compute -> Physical
Infrastructure -> Servers*. On the server list, we check one or more checkboxes
to select the servers to be used in the provisioning request. This enables the
*Lifecycle* menu.

image::docs_redfish_using15_lifecycle_provisioning_menu.png[alt="Lifecycle menu for Provisioning Selected Physical Servers",350,align="center"]

Click the *Lifecycle -> Provision Selected Physical Servers*. This opens the
dialog for filling in the request.

image::docs_redfish_using16_provisioning_dialog_default.png[alt="Provision Selected Physical Servers dialog",350,align="center"]

NOTE: If from the server list, we click on a server, then we can initiate the
same dialog by clicking *Lifecycle -> Provision Physical Server* from the
Physical Server's summary.

The dialog informs us on the number of servers selected for this request. It
presents the following fields that we need to fill:

* *PXE Server*: selection of the PXE servers registered in the
  {product-appliance}.
* *PXE Image*: pick a name of the Operating System image that the selected
  servers should be booted into.
* *Customization Template*: pick the name of the customization template to be
  applied at each selected server. The customization templates provide custom
  instructions used by the Operating System installers to perform unattended
  installation.

image::docs_redfish_using17_provisioning_dialog_example.png[alt="Provision Selected Physical Servers dialog - example",350,align="center"]

Send the request by clicking *Provision*.

==== Approving the Request for Physical Server Provisioning
A privileged user of {product-appliance} has to approve the request. They
visit *Services -> Requests* and look for the request of type Physical Server
Provision and request status Pending.

image::docs_redfish_using18_requests_provisioning_pending.png[alt="Pending provisioning request on request list",500,align="center"]

They should open the request and click the Approve (the tick) button, then
provide text input to *Reason* and click *Submit*.

image::docs_redfish_using19_provisioning_request_approve.png[alt="Provisioning request approval",450,align="center"]

They will receive a pop-up showing that they have successfully approved the
request.

image::docs_redfish_using20_provisioning_request_approval_notification.png[alt="Provisioning request success docs_redfish_using20_provisioning_request_approval_notification",500,align="center"]

After a few minutes, we refresh the requests list and find that the
request state has changed to Provisioned.

image::docs_redfish_using21_provisioning_request_provisioned.png[alt="Provisioning request provisioned",500,align="center"]

NOTE: The {redfish-provider-full} currently has no means of knowing when the
provisioning has actually finished. Therefore, the status Provisioned indicates
that the {redfish-provider} has successfully configured the PXE server to serve
the selected image and customization template, has set the servers to boot once into network boot, and rebooted the servers. This initiates the actual process
of Operating System booting and installation, which then takes additional time
before it finishes.
